## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
-   Receive form validation messages if:
    -   A required field has been missed
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly
-   Complete the form only using their keyboard
-   Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

-   I learded a little more on validation, although I feel I could have implemented it better this is whatr I came up with. Hopefully I can get some good feedback on it.
-   Learned about the `:has()` selector in CSS.
-   Learned a cool way to add a toast

### Continued development

-   I do want to continue doing forms specifically validation on form. I want to get better at it and find a better solution.
